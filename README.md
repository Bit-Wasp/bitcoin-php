## Presently supported:

 - Blocks, headers, and merkle blocks and bloom filters
 - P2SH & Segregated witness scripts
 - An adaptable elliptic-curve library, using [[PhpEcc](https://github.com/mdanter/phpecc)] by default, or libsecp256k1 if the bindings are found
 - Support for building, parsing, signing/validating transactions
 - Deterministic signatures (RFC6979)
 - BIP32 and electrum (older type I) deterministic key algorithms
 - BIP39, and the older electrum seed format.
 - ScriptFactory for common input/output types, parser, interpreter, and classifiers
 - Supports bindings to libbitcoinconsensus
 - Bindings to Stratum (electrum) servers
